# Pacmen Factory
## Introduction
As part of the MIT xPRO course, we were given a starter file and then asked to create a pacman factory. Two buttons add multiple pacmen to the screen and start the game. 
Each pacman bounces off any wall that it hits.

## Usage
For fun!

## Roadmap
Make the pacmen image change direction when they bounce off the walls.
